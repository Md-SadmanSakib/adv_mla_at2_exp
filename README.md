This project focuses on building two models for an American retailer with 10 stores across California, Texas, and Wisconsin. The first model is a machine learning-based predictive model to estimate daily sales revenue for specific items at individual stores. The second model is a time-series forecasting model that predicts total sales revenue across all stores and items for the next 7 days. The models are deployed as APIs using Streamlit to provide real-time predictions and forecasts for business use.
